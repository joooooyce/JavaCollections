# JavaCollections

Implement the following using the Java Collection Framework:  
1: Define the following 2 collections  
  * one containing integers 1 through 10 (random order)
  * one containing integers 6 through 15 (random order)
  * print both collections
  * print size of both collections

2. Combine the above 2 collections into a 3rd collection
  * collection cannot have any duplicates
  * collection must be sorted
  * remove the middle entry
  * print the collection in reverse order
  * print the size of the collection
3. Define a collection that contains a key/value pair
  * add 5 key/value pairs to the collection
  * add a duplicate key/value pair to the collection (one of the five that was added)
    - check for duplicate key & print key/value if found (do not add it to the collection)
  * print the key/value pairs
  * print the size of the collection when done
  * comment the code and explain why the specific collection type was chosen
